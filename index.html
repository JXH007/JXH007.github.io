        <p class="lead mb-4">I don't really have a work experience because I never applied for any work. My major is pre-business and I have no intentions of changing my major yet. Something about my major would be how an undergraduate curriculum called Pre-Business is intended for individuals who are thinking about pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration. The program's objectives are to increase the likelihood of success for students who are dedicated to obtaining this degree and to provide information to those who are thinking about enrolling in the business program. All of the Pre-Business Program's courses are foundational business courses. Prior to enrolling in the focus, students will first study these courses. The student may submit an application to the School of Business and Economics to be designated as a Business major after successfully completing the required courses with an overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 and a School of Business and Economics GPA of 2.5. On top of that, transfer students may petition to have credits taken at other authorized schools accepted for substitution and participate in the Pre-Business Program (cui.edu). <br><br>

        After earning an associate's degree in pre-business administration, what comes next would be pursuing further into the career options. It is highly recommended that students pursue a Bachelor of Business Administration degree as a means of furthering their education in this field. Depending on which bachelor's degree you choose to pursue, your job possibilities will change. UC offers fully online bachelor's degrees, including courses in finance and marketing. The Carl H. Lindner College of Business (LCoB) offers a number of other majors, including information systems, accounting, operations management, international business, entrepreneurship, economics, and real estate. Students who select the Pre-Business Administration Associate Program as their career path will be eligible for entry-level jobs in government, nonprofit, and corporate settings. These jobs will typically be in human resources, marketing, production, finance, accounting, and purchasing. Possibilities for employment could consist of, but are not restricted to: Customer service representative, sales support specialist, store manager, sales consultant, sales supervisor, and relationship banker(online.uc.edu).<br><br>

        Also, at UCR things may be different, A two-year curriculum called Pre-Business helps students become ready to apply to business administration programs. (UC Riverside, UC Irvine, and UC Berkeley are the only universities that offer the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree.) Initially enrolled as pre-business students, freshman at UCR are urged to enroll in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. During the freshman and sophomore years, students fulfill the criteria for the College's breadth as well as the prerequisites for a major in business administration. At the conclusion of the sophomore year, an application is made to the business administration program. Students are advised in the School of Business, Undergraduate Business Program Administration, after being accepted as majors in Business Administration. In order to electronically submit the Business Administration Application and fulfill the requirements for College Breadth and lower division Business Administration, Pre-Business students must view an online Business Administration Workshop during that quarter. By the time they have finished ninety units, students need to apply to Business Administration. The Director of the School of Business Undergraduate Programs Office must first approve any exclusions (ucr.edu).
